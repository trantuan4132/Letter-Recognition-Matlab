# Letter-Recognition-Matlab

This repository compare models used to recognize letters from images via performance (training time, accuracy). 
The models are coded from scratch in Matlab programming language.

## Available models:

- [Perceptron:](Perceptron)

- [Neural Network - v1:](Neural_Network_v1)

- [Neural Network - v2:](Neural_Network_v2)

- [Deeper Neural Network - v1:](Deeper_Neural_Network_v1)
