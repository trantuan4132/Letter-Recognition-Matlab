# Letter-Recognition-Matlab

This repository compare models used to recognize letters from images via performance (training time, accuracy). 
The models are coded from scratch in Matlab programming language.

## Available models:

- Neural Network - v1:
  - 1 input layer (784 units)
  - 1 hidden layer (1024 units, sigmoid activation)
  - 1 output layer (26 units, sigmoid activation)

- Neural Network - v2:
  - 1 input layer (784 units)
  - 1 hidden layer (1024 units, relu activation)
  - 1 output layer (26 units, softmax activation)
